I have 7+ years experience as a fullstack cloud engineer building products on AWS.

I love to learn new tech and recently passed my AWS Solutions Architect Professional exam.

Looking forward to being a strong contributor to my next team. 🍿

### 🌇 My Last Adventure
Founded an R&D Cloud team at [iZotope](https://izotope.com/) with [Jonathan Shapiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-shapiro-7b89748/).
Created groundbreaking new apps in the areas of mastering, audio repair, and song idea generation using cloud DSP architectures

One of our last products :notes: [Trackstarter](https://trackstarter.labs.izotope.com/) :notes: is still live and available to check out. 
It is a web app my team and I created to help get started on new songs.
